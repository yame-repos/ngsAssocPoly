Description: Tools for genetic mapping in autopolyploids using low-coverage NGS genotyping data.
    Allele dosage of genetic mapping populations are estimated using read count information in NGS genotype data.
    Association between the estimated allele dosage and phenotypes are analyzed using generalized linear regression models (GLM).
